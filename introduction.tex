\todo{Introductory words?}

In this paper we present a formal description of the application of truncated Wigner representation to simulating the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs).
The method works in the limit of large atom numbers and accounts for nonlinear losses in multi-component condensates.
We reduce the problem in its initial form, the master equation for bosonic field operators, to the system of stochastic differential equations, which have significantly lower complexity (at a price of making several approximations).
