Dear editorial board of the Journal of Mathematical Physics,

Please find enclosed the manuscript: "Functional Wigner representation of BEC quantum dynamics", by Bogdan Opanchuk and Peter D. Drummond, to be submitted as a new article.

In this manuscript we present a formal treatment of the functional Wigner representation, a phase-space mapping of field creation and annihilation operators. We state and prove all the theorems required to make a transition from the master equation to a set of numerically solvable stochastic differential equations.

This approach has been used in a number of works, but has never been explicitly formalized, and we hope that our manuscript will serve as a convenient reference for future applications.


Sincerely yours,
Bogdan Opanchuk on behalf of the authors.
