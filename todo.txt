Notation:
- Do we need explicit statement about the format of types for functions/functionals?
- Do we need explicit notation for "restricted" functions, like tilda over restricted operators?
- Should we write \tilde{\rho}, when we know that it belongs to the restricted subspace? Same question for the displacement operator.
- Can we use matrix form of FPE-SDE transitions?
- \tilde{\delta} for the delta functional is a bit inconsistent. What's wrong with \Delta? Also, an index \mathbb{M} would be nice, because normal delta has it.
- Isn't it better to use <> instead of {} to denote the average over simulation paths?

Other:
- Does AIP require shortened journal names? Need to fix buildbib.py in this case.
- Do we need to proof that W transformation of Hermitian operator is a real-valued function?
- What is the vector "n" in eqn:master-eqn:effective-H? 
- Do we need to provide Wigner function for initial state other than coherent?
